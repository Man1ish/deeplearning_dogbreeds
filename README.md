One of the challenging tasks in object classification is Fine-grained image classification that aims to classify sub-categories from a large category through fine-grained images. In this classification, it is not easy to distinguish the subtle features that can fully separate the object. The aim of this project is to classify the fine-grained dataset (i.e., dog breed) using a convolutional neural network. We achieved an accuracy of 89.66% using our model.
